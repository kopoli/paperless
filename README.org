* Paperless office interface

  Reads the texts of images and makes them browsable and searchable via HTTP.

  This includes a web server written in Golang that serves an interface in
  AngularJS. The same binary can be used to upload images into the server.

   and processing:

   #+begin_src shell
   sudo apt-get install sqlite3 tesseract-ocr-osd tesseract-ocr-fin tesseract-ocr imagemagick unpaper
   #+end_src

   Also Golang is required. Should work with v1.4.2 and v1.5.

   Clone this repository and run the following command:

   #+begin_src shell
   go build
   #+end_src

   #+begin_src shell
   ./paperless start-web
   #+end_src

   Upload images:
